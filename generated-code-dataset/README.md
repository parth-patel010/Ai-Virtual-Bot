# Generated Code Dataset

This folder contains all code generated by the Gemini AI for potential training of a custom c2 model.

## Structure

Each generation is saved as a separate folder with:
- `prompt.txt` - The original user prompt
- `index.html` - Generated HTML code
- `style.css` - Generated CSS code
- `script.js` - Generated JavaScript code
- `metadata.json` - Generation metadata (timestamp, model used, etc.)

## Training Data Format

The data is organized in a format suitable for training a custom code generation model:
- Input: User prompts (natural language descriptions)
- Output: Structured web code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Usage

This dataset can be used to:
1. Train a custom c2 model on your specific coding patterns
2. Fine-tune existing models for better performance
3. Analyze common patterns in generated code
4. Create a knowledge base of working code examples

## File Naming Convention

Folders are named with format: `generation_{id}_{timestamp}`
Example: `generation_1_2025-01-05_17-40-30`
